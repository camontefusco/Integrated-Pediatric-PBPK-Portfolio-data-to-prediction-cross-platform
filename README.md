# Integrated Pediatric PBPK Portfolio Showcase

## Overview
Demonstrate the complete pediatric PBPK workflow from data aggregation to adult model development, pediatric predictions, and predictive performance evaluation.

## Objective
Showcase preterm neonates, biologics, prodrugs, polypharmacy, formulation differences, and cross-platform reproducibility in a single integrated demonstration.

## Tools
- PK-Sim for GUI-based modeling
- mrgsolve for reproducible simulations
- Python/R for analysis and plotting

## Innovation / Twists
- Integrates **all previous projects** into a cohesive portfolio
- Covers multiple drug types and elimination pathways
- Includes optional **AI/ML for performance evaluation**
- EMA-ready demonstration of Stage 1–2 pipeline

## Deliverables
- Modular demonstration notebook linking **data → adult models → pediatric predictions → evaluation**
- Representative plots and metrics for EMA visualization
- Optional PDF summary report

## EMA Alignment
Demonstrates the **full pipeline** from Stage 1 (data aggregation) through Stage 2.3 (predictive performance evaluation).
